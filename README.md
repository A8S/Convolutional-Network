# Convolutional network
###### - this is my version of a convolutional neural network without using any machine learning libraries -    

The purpose of this project is to understand what's going on in a conv net while recognizing images.    
Some of my future ideas include:     
- building an interactive interface for visualizing the filters that are being trained    
- building a generative model that reproduces the image based on a label
